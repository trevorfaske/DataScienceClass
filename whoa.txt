Whoa, we're half-way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it. I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

And I am
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love
